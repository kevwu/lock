This repository contains the code + designs for a Raspberry Pi-controlled deadbolt.

## Required Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- [Stepper motors](https://www.amazon.com/Industry-Park-28BYJ-48-Stepper-ULN2003/dp/B01J507JGS/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1492807485&sr=8-5&keywords=12v+stepper+motor)
  - These are everywhere, they're incredibly common. I found that the 5V version wasn't powerful enough to move my deadbolt and kept getting stuck, so I got the 12V ones linked here. If you do this, just get a 12V 1A power supply, cut off the end and solder the +/- wires to some female headers. Then hook the output up to the driver (they take 5-12V.)
